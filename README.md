# Book tracker Project

This is my Book tracker app. It's a simple app to keep track of which books you are currently reading, want to read and which you have already read.


## Future development

I'm thinking of adding a few new features:
1. More decent design
2. Rate the books you have read
3. Support for smaller devices
4. User login


## Development environment

To get the app up and running for development environments you need to have `git`, `nodejs` and `npm` installed.

Then do the following:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [url]
   ```
   - You can get the url from the top right corner (`Clone or download ðŸ”½`)
2. Navigate into the cloned project:
   ```sh
   cd book-tracker
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   - This can take a minute or two depending on your network connection
4. Start the development server:
    ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   - This can also take a minute or two
